# Sales-Analysis
This contains some analysis on sample sales data over 12 months on electronic products. 
The aim of this analysis was to apply my learnings with regard to python, pandas and matplotlib to sample data.

The objectives of the project were sourced from: https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks

<b>What I learned</b>
- Concatenating multiple csv files into one.
- Cleaning the dataset through the use of dropna() and a condition to remove strings matching a certain pattern.
- How to change the datatype of a column.
- Adding new column to a DataFrame.
- The importance of breaking up the question at hand into sub tasks.
- How to use the .groupby(), to_datetime(), apply(), .transform() and drop_duplicates methods.
